            fullIntro: 'Prerana has been in many situations where she was – “one of the few”! Because she’s a risk taker, she is able to venture into areas where she wouldn’t have otherwise. While pursuing her mechanical engineering degree, Prerana was one of five girls in a program of over 300 undergraduates. Similarly, at Airbus, she was the only woman on the shop floor to work on wing design of aircrafts. Furthermore, at PwC, she was the only person with a STEM background. At each of these instances, Prerana has had immense growth and a plethora of learning. Instead of hiding behind the crowd, she’s used these rare opportunities to shine and contribute to my team being a member of an immigrant, women, and person of color community. Prerana is now ready for the next risk and endeavor to embark on an entrepreneurial journey with her own start-up – Vulcan Aerial Firefighting',
