        intro: 'I have been in many situations where I was – “one of the few”! Because I’m a risk taker, I am able to venture into areas where I wouldn’t have otherwise. While pursuing my mechanical engineering degree, I was one of five girls in a program of over 300 undergraduates. Similarly, at Airbus, I was the only woman on the shop floor to work on wing design of aircrafts. Furthermore, at PwC, I was the only person with a STEM background. At each of these instances, I have had immense growth and a plethora of learning. Instead of hiding behind the crowd, I used these rare opportunities to shine and contribute to my team being a member of an immigrant, women, and person of color community. I am now ready for the next risk and endeavor to embark on an entrepreneurial journey with my own start-up – Vulcan Aerial Firefighting',

After finally owning her blindness and coming to terms with chronic illness while reflecting on her Asian identity, Anne rewrote the path her life would take to build up and inspire the vision loss and chronic illness community to break barriers and see beauty while making the view accessible in social media. See how her journey challenges barriers to make connection and communication barrier-free. No audience member should be left behind.',

These "hard arts" - for one has to be brave if they venture to be laughed at, and equally as brave to sit in silence with themselves - aren\'t two dichotomous poles, but rather two sides of the same coin.
