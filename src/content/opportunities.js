This year, TEDxSFU invites people who dare to reflect on themselves and the issues surrounding the world. People who have stepped out of the norm and broken their comfort to embark on a journey unknown, people who visualize their accomplishments, people who celebrate their bloom through reflection. We want to hear your innovative and empowering stories of reflection, what makes you unique, what is your reflection? \nBecome a TEDxSFU Speaker and mirror your unknown journeys with us!\nAs a TEDxSFU Speaker, you will be working closely with the TEDxSFU Content Development Team, Project Leads, and Speaker Coaches.
